# PointDefence, Raylib Demo - C Port
The reason for this port is partially due to the annoyance of packaging the C# workflow, and partly because the end goal was to move to Raylib with C anyway.

## How it was Built

### Systems:
#### PointDefence C#
This was [originally built](https://github.com/P-Jon/PointDefenceGame) with C# in Visual Studio; the [Raylib Library](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs) (v3.5.0) C# binding for creating games without major hassle.

#### PointDefence C
Built using C, handling the build process manually; with the [Raylib Library](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) (v3.7.0) in its original format.
